his program simulates rolling two dice a user-specified number of times. It displays the result of each roll, counts how many times the total is 6 or 7, and prints summary statistics at the end.

- User input & validation: Prompting the user for the number of rolls and checking if the input is valid (â‰¥ 1).
- Loops: Using a for loop to repeat an action a set number of times.
- Random number generation: Using random.randint(1,6) to simulate dice rolls.
- Conditionals: Applying if statements to count special cases (totals of 6 or 7).
- Counters/accumulators: Tracking how many times certain results occur.
- Formatted output: Printing each roll clearly, and summarizing results at the end.
